1. getStaticProps
Usage: This is used for Static Generation. When you use getStaticProps, Next.js generates the HTML at build time. The pre-rendered HTML is then reused on each request, making the page very fast.

When to use: If a page can be pre-rendered ahead of user's request and doesn't need to be updated frequently, then getStaticProps is a good choice. This is especially useful for content that doesn't change often, like blog posts or product listings.

Return value: It should return an object with:

props: An object containing the props for the page component. These props will be passed to the page component.
revalidate (optional): A number in seconds on how often Next.js should re-generate the page. Useful for "stale-while-revalidate" strategies.
Note: getStaticProps runs at build time in production, and it does not receive data from the user request, like query parameters or HTTP headers.

2. getServerSideProps
Usage: This is used for Server-side Rendering. When you use getServerSideProps, Next.js generates the HTML on-the-fly with each request. The page is rendered on the server for each request.

When to use: If a page needs to display frequently updated data, or data that varies for each user/request, then getServerSideProps is a good choice. Examples include user dashboards or pages that display data that changes often and is unique per user.

Return value: It should return an object with:

props: An object containing the props for the page component. These props will be passed to the page component.
Note: getServerSideProps runs on every request, and it receives the full context of the request, such as query parameters and HTTP headers.

Key Differences:
Build Time vs. Request Time:

getStaticProps: Generates HTML at build time.
getServerSideProps: Generates HTML on every request.
Performance:

getStaticProps: Typically faster since it serves pre-rendered HTML.
getServerSideProps: Can be slower since it renders the page on-the-fly for every request.
Data Freshness:

getStaticProps: Suitable for data that doesn't change often. However, with the revalidate option, you can implement a "stale-while-revalidate" strategy.
getServerSideProps: Suitable for data that changes frequently or is user-specific.
Access to Request and Response Context:

getStaticProps: Doesn't have access to the request or response objects.
getServerSideProps: Has access to the full request and response context.
In summary, your choice between getStaticProps and getServerSideProps will depend on your application's needs. If you prioritize performance and the data doesn't change often, opt for getStaticProps. If you need fresh data on every request or have user-specific content, choose getServerSideProps.
